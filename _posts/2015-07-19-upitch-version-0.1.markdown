We have seen so many useless presentation templates online that only make your presentations look 'good'. What good are presentations if people listening to them don't get what you are trying to say.

Tired of all the crappy stuff online, we decided to make some presentation templates ourselves and wondered if it was more useful than ordinary presentation templates that just looked pretty.

Most people give presentations to clients, VCs and professors. We decided that corporations already have the budget so our first few templates are intended to help students and startups.

<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
